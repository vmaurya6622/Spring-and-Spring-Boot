     -> Spring IoC is the core of spring framework. it creates, manages objects
        and lifecycle of beans.
     -> Types of IoC:
             - BeanFactory
             - ApplicationContext
     bean factory is the basic version of IoC container as it provides basic support for DI and bean lifecycle management.
     whereas ApplicationContext is an extension of BeanFactory with more enterprise features like even propagation and internalisation.

     when we use lazy initialisation then object is created at runtime when needed and when not using it
     the object is created before runtime which makes the runtime even faster.
     Application Context implementing classes:
         -> AnnotationConfigApplicationContext Container
         -> AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext
         -> XmlWebApplicationCopntext
         -> FileSystemXmlApplicationConext
         -> ClassPathXmlApplicationContext
