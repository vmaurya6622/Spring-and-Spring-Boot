    -> Inversion of control (IoC)
        -> IoC is a design principle in software design where traditional flow is reversed.
        -> In here, control of object creation is handed over to a framework or container.
        -> it improves modularity and flexibility which helps the maintainable and testable code.
    -> Dependency Injection
        -> DI is the design patter  used to implement IoC. It involves injecting dependencies into a class
           rather than the class creating them itself.
